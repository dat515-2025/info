# Guide to get Unix Account

## UiS Unix System

Machines in UiS Unix system, named `gorina1` - `gorina3`, can be accessed remotely.
See below for more information about this.

### Task: Sign up for Unix Account - Do It Now

Some of you may already have done this one:
You will need a Unix account to access machines in the Linux lab.
Get an account for UiSâ€™ Unix system by following [these instructions](https://user.ux.uis.no).
Be sure to read the section **Using the UNIX system**.

**Note for Returning Students:**
If you are an old student and had a Unix account before, which has expired, do not create a new Unix account.
Instead, mention your old Unix account details when submitting your application for reactivation.
The Unix administration team will reactivate your old Unix account.

If your account is active, you don't have to do anything.

### Accessing UiS Unix Machines

To access the Unix system from outside UiS campus, you need to use one of the following jump hosts:

```log
ssh1.ux.uis.no
ssh2.ux.uis.no
ssh3.ux.uis.no
ssh4.ux.uis.no
```

From these jump servers you can access other Linux machines such as `gorina1` - `gorina3`.
